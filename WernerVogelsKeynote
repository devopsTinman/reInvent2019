========================================
Classic Virtualization
- Mainframe / timesharing
- VMWare
AWS Nitro
- offloading workload to separate cards
- https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/
- up to 4x improvement in instance network Throughput
- trust no one: Kill Dom0
- no SSH (or other access) to the hypervisor
- passive communications design
- hypervisor cannot talk back to the nitro controller
  - if it does talk back, then it's compromised
- nitro controller cannot talk to external control plane
  - if it does talk back, then it's compromised
- encrypt everything
- Root of trust
  - cryptographically check all components on startup
------------------------------------------------------
Firecracker
- fargate scales up and down much faster than ec2's with less latency
- Firecracker microVM - only implements the devices needed
- https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/
- https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/firecracker-open-source-secure-fast-microvm-serverless/
Lambda
- Enterprises are rapidly adopting serverless
- Dowd - Vanguard
  - no downtime tolerated
  - 2500 applications
  - business value at startup speed
    - continuous delivery
    - devops
    - daily Deployments
  - almost 100% cloud
Evolvable architecture
- S3 is now 262 microservices
- Everything fails all the time
- Regional architecture - cell based
- zonal cell based
- not all data needs to be accessible to all clients
- Physalia
  - millions of tiny databases
  - colony of micro-cells
  - error rate against configuration master dropped immensely after Physalia
  - shuffle sharding
Amazon Builders Library
- https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library
Sebastian - S
- Saildrone global fleet
- Saildrone forecast app
- 85% of seabed is unexplored
- Ocean Surveyor - 1 ton of sonar equipment / 72 foot vehicle
Industry 4.0
- Automation
- average age of equipment is 20+ years old
- use machine learning to predict how orders should be ordered,
  bought and delivered
- Improving workplace safety
  - woodside natural gas
- Volkswagen
- Aquabyte
